<p>
  Vulnerability Assessment with Kali Linux and Nessus
Platform: VMware | Tools Used: Kali Linux, Tenable Nessus

Project Overview:
In this lab, I configured a virtual machine to run Kali Linux and installed Tenable Nessus to perform a vulnerability assessment on my host machine. This project demonstrated my ability to identify, analyze, and recommend solutions for security vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

Key Tasks and Skills Demonstrated:

Configured a Kali Linux virtual machine 

Installed and set up Tenable Nessus to scan the host system for vulnerabilities.

Performed a basic vulnerability scan, reviewing system configurations, missing patches, and potential exploit risks.

Documented the scan results, including risk levels, CVE references, and affected services.

Provided recommended remediation steps based on best practices .
